# CopyWords
This is a helper tool for adding new Danish words into [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/).

I have customized Anki's card template to contain additional information about a word, such as transcription, sound file, etc. CopyWord tool makes it to fill a new card with information by automatically finding a word in online Danish dictionary and parsing different parts. Then you can click on various "Copy text" buttons to copy the text into clipboard and then paste it into Anki editor.

First type a word or its part in the "Search" texbox and click FInd. If this word exists in the [Den Danske Ordbog](http://ordnet.dk/ddo/) online dictionary, it will be parsed and presented in the tool.
Use "copy" buttons to copy relevant text into clipboard and paste it into the Anki card editor. 

## Sound
"Play sound" button will download mp3 file (if it exists) and play it.
"Save sound" button will normalize the sound file (change its volume) and save into Anki's media collection folder.
